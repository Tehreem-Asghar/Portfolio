            Hello! I&apos;m Tehreem Asghar, a full stack developer from new
            Karachi, Pakistan. My journey into tech began while I was preparing
            for my second-year exams, when I learned about a test being held for
            admission to a new AI and tech-focused university at the Governor
            House. Out of 500,000 students who took the test, only 50,000 were
            selectedâ€”Alhamdulillah, I was one of them.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            While the university was being set up, I started learning HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript. Once classes began, I trained in TypeScript. After
            completing the initial assignments and passing the interview, I
            earned the title of senior student. Currently, I am studying Next.js
            and also pursuing my BA through private exams, focusing on both my
            education and skills.
